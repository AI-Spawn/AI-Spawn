# About Me

I'm a student who's passionate about programming and computer science.  Although my main programming language is Python, I'm also proficient in Java, JavaScript/TypeScript (Node, Deno, and Web), and C#. I also have some experience with C++ and VBA.



I use tags on my repos to categorize them:

**[Production](https://github.com/AI-Spawn?tab=repositories&q=production)** - A tool made for other people to actually use, and it has a clean codebase. 

**[Good](https://github.com/AI-Spawn?tab=repositories&q=good)** - It's an interesting project and the codebase isn't too bad, but I also don't expect anybody else to use it.

**[Random](https://github.com/AI-Spawn?tab=repositories&q=random)** - It's just a random project I decided to do. These are generally small projects, and I probably didn't put any though into not writing spaghetti. 

**[Bad](https://github.com/AI-Spawn?tab=repositories&q=bad)** - Old projects I made before I knew what spaghetti code even was.
